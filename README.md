# Etch-a-Sketch Project

## Description

Project 4 in Foundations for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This is my second **HTML/JS** project, and my first to include **CSS**.

Drag your mouse cursor over the grid to draw with either black or a series of randomized colors. You can change the grid size and toggle the grid freely.

### Benefits

- Deepened understanding of event listeners & DOM Manipulation
- In particular, made clear concepts relating to class & style manipulation
- Experimented with various HTML input styles
- Refreshed basic CSS concepts such as flexbox

## Improvements

The baseline of this project was not terribly challenging. Most hangups came from implementing things such as the random drawing method. With my choice of implementation (i.e. redrawing all of the filled cells when drawing type is changed), I was unable to implement an incremental drawing feature. Additionally, there is a degree of wonkiness with the grid borders that I chose to ignore rather than tinker with endlessly. A list of things I might improve upon in this project are:

- Implmement incremental drawing
- More color options/inputs in general
- Fix aforementioned border issues/wonkiness
- Generally improve UI
